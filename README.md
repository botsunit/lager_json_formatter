## Lager JSON Formatter

[![Hex.pm](https://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/lager_json_formatter.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/lager_json_formatter)

### Erlang 

sys.config :

```erlang
{lager, [
  {handlers, [
    {lager_console_backend, [info, {lager_default_formatter, [date, " ", time," [",severity,"] -- ", module, ":", function, " (", pid, "/", line, ") -- ", message, "\n"]}]},
    {lager_file_backend, [{file, "log/wok_error.log"}, {level, error}, {formatter, lager_json_formatter}, {formatter_config, [date, time, severity, module, function, line, pid]}]},
    {lager_file_backend, [{file, "log/wok_debug.log"}, {level, debug}, {formatter, lager_json_formatter}, {formatter_config, [date, time, severity, module, function, line, pid]}]},
    {lager_file_backend, [{file, "log/wok_console.log"}, {level, info}, {formatter, lager_json_formatter}, {formatter_config, [date, time, severity, module, function, line, pid]}]}
  ]}
]}
```

rebar.config :

```erlang
{lager_json_formatter, "0.2.3"}
```

```erlang
{lager_default_formatter, {git, "https://github.com/G-Corp/lager_json_formatter.git", {tag, "0.2.3"}}}
```

erlang.mk :

```Makefile
dep_lager_json_formatter = hex 0.2.3
```

ok

```Makefile
dep_lager_json_formatter = git https://github.com/G-Corp/lager_json_formatter 0.2.3
```

### Elixir

config.exs :

```elixir
config :lager,
  handlers: [
    lager_console_backend: [:info, {:lager_default_formatter, [:date, ' ', :time, ' [', :severity, '] -- ', :module, ':', :function, ' (', :pid, '/', :line, ') -- ', :message, '\n']}],
    lager_file_backend: [file: 'log/wok_error.log', level: :error, formatter: :lager_json_formatter, formatter_config: [date, time, severity, module, function, line, pid]],
    lager_file_backend: [file: 'log/wok_debug.log', level: :debug, formatter: :lager_json_formatter, formatter_config: [date, time, severity, module, function, line, pid]],
    lager_file_backend: [file: 'log/wok_console.log', level: :info, formatter: :lager_json_formatter, formatter_config: [date, time, severity, module, function, line, pid]]
  ]
```

mix.exs :

```elixir
{:lager_json_formatter, "~> 0.2.3"}
```

or

```elixir
{:lager_json_formatter, git: "https://github.com/G-Corp/lager_json_formatter.git", branch: "master"},
```

### Formatter

The output is formated as a JSON string. By default, this module use this format :

```erlang
[{date, [date, " ", time]}, 
 message, 
 pid, 
 severity, 
 {component, [{module, "-"}, ":", {function, "-"}, "/", {line, "-"}]}]).
```

Thus, the output will be something like :

```erlang
<<"{\"component\":\"module:function/10\","
  "\"date\":\"2016-06-14 12:26:40.000\","
  "\"message\":\"my message\","
  "\"pid\":\"<0.0.0>\","
  "\"severity\":\"info\"}\n">>
```

By default a field use it own name as key. So if in the format list you use `date` this will generate a key-value `"date": "2016-06-14"`. You can change the field key by using a tuple where the first element is the key and the second one is the value. So `{msg, message}` will generate `{"msg": "My message"}`. The value can be a list. In this case, the result will be a concatenation of this list ; for example `{datetime, [date, " ", time]}` will generate `{"datetime": "2016-06-14 12:26:40.000"}`.
